Hello friends, welcome to our latest article. As you all know, the Uttar Pradesh government has issued a strict order making e-KYC mandatory for ration cardholders. All beneficiaries must complete their e-KYC by February 15, 2025. Failure to do so will result in the cancellation of their ration card, which means they will no longer be eligible for free ration under government schemes.

According to the information received, if beneficiaries do not complete their e-KYC within the given timeframe, their ration cards will be canceled. Currently, in Gorakhpur district alone, approximately 6.62 lakh units have not completed their e-KYC, which is a significant number.

## Risk of Ration Reduction Due to Incomplete e-KYC

Additionally, if even one member of a ration cardholderâ€™s family does not complete e-KYC, their name will be removed from the ration card. This means the family will receive one unit less of ration. To avoid this issue, all beneficiaries should complete their e-KYC as soon as possible.

The government has also instructed ration dealers to raise awareness about e-KYC by going door-to-door. These dealers are preparing a list of beneficiaries who have not yet completed their e-KYC.

## Complete e-KYC at the Ration Shop

Beneficiaries can easily complete their e-KYC by visiting their nearest ration shop. This process is simple and free of charge. Initially, the deadline for e-KYC was December 31, 2024, but it has now been extended to February 15, 2025, to ensure that no eligible beneficiary is left out of the scheme.

The primary objective of implementing the e-KYC process is to eliminate fake units. If an unauthorized name or unit is linked to a ration card, it will be detected and removed through e-KYC. This ensures that only genuine and eligible beneficiaries receive the benefits of the scheme.

## e-KYC Process

Beneficiaries who wish to complete their e-KYC must visit their nearest ration shop, public service center, or e-Mitra center. They need to carry their Aadhaar card and ration card. The e-KYC process will be completed through biometric verification.

Additionally, beneficiaries can also complete the e-KYC process online by visiting the Food Supply Department's website and uploading their Aadhaar and ration card details.

Stay informed and complete your e-KYC before the deadline to continue receiving government ration benefits.
